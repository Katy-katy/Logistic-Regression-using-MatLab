# Logistic-Regression-using-MatLab

It is Programming Exercise 2 for Machine Learning Classe (Stanford)

https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome

In this exercise I implemented  logistic regression and applyed it to two different datasets.

Files that were provided by  Andrew Ng who tought this class:
ex2.m - Octave/MATLAB script that steps you through the exercise ex2 
reg.m - Octave/MATLAB script for the later parts of the exercise 
ex2data1.txt - Training set for the first half of the exercise 
ex2data2.txt - Training set for the second half of the exercise 
submit.m - Submission script that sends your solutions to our servers 
mapFeature.m - Function to generate polynomial features 
plotDecisionBoundary.m - Function to plot classifierâ€™s decision boundary

I completed these files:
plotData.m - Function to plot 2D classification data
sigmoid.m - Sigmoid Function
costFunction.m - Logistic Regression Cost Function
predict.m - Logistic Regression Prediction Function
costFunctionReg.m - Regularized Logistic Regression Cost
